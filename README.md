# aqua Test Recorder
aqua Test recorder is a powerful assistant in Chrome that helps you run your manual tests on any webpage.

## Key features:
- Test any webpage while all events from manual interactions with web pages will be automatically recorded: clicks, keystrokes, URL changes etc.
- Edit the captured data to distil the essentials and define what exact events you need to save;
- Leave comments or notes to provide additional information about what happened;
- Take screenshots of the whole screen or specific areas;
- Transfer captured details to aqua for further reporting.

## Why aqua test Recorder?
With aqua Test Recorder you reduce the time spent on running your tests by 2X. While testing the webpage, you don’t need to switch between aqua and the application under the test because you have everything at hand and can focus on the flow and finding the bugs.
